Defines the domain for which to enumerate subdomains.
Installs the required tools (Findomain, SubFinder, Amass, and AssetFinder) if they are not already present on the system.
Uses each of the tools to find subdomains of the given domain, and saves the results to a separate file.
Combines the results from all tools into a single file, sorts the results to remove duplicates, and saves the final list of subdomains.

Note: This script assumes that the apt-get and go commands are available on the system. It also assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to install the required tools.
